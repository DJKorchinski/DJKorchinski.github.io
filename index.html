<h2>Research</h2>
I study phase transitions in complex systems. 
At a phase transition, dynamics become correlated across the system, leading to scale-free fluctuations, which in some contexts we recognize as avalanches.
In my MSc with Joern Davidsen, I studied neuronal avalanches and how the phase transition in that context <a href= "https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.021059">might be altered</a> by sensory input or spontaneous activation (e.g. by spontaneous neurotransmitter release). 
For my PhD, I am studying avalanches that appear as amorphous solids are deformed. 
As with my MSc, I like to understand to what extent the "clean" phase transition exists: are <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.034603">finite-size effects</a> ruling the system? What about temperature effects?
